        <h1>toki pona keyboard layout</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I recently created a keyboard layout for toki pona. Now, you might be like "why ?". Well, I have 3 reasons for creating this <i>beauuutiful</i> layout:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Qwerty keyboard (or any other keyboard layout) has a lot of letters that are not used in toki pona</li>
          <li>these keyboard layouts don't have the most used letters in toki pona in their center</li>
          <li>there can be a kijetesantaklu key</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, with the helpful collaboration of @skrybl, I started creating the keyboard layout. The first thing I did was scan a long text in toki pona I had written to see the most commonly used letters. And, after long hours of VC on discord with skrybl as well as other (fascinated) spectators, we came up with this beautiful layout: </p> <br>
